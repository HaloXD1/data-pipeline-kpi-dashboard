# Retail Data Pipeline and KPI Dashboard

[![Tests](https://github.com/AhmedYasserShalaby/data-pipeline-kpi-dashboard/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/AhmedYasserShalaby/data-pipeline-kpi-dashboard/actions/workflows/tests.yml)
[![Secret Scan](https://github.com/AhmedYasserShalaby/data-pipeline-kpi-dashboard/actions/workflows/secret-scan.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/AhmedYasserShalaby/data-pipeline-kpi-dashboard/actions/workflows/secret-scan.yml)

Data Engineering / BI project that turns messy retail exports into validated SQLite warehouse tables, KPI datasets, and a Streamlit dashboard.

## Quick Scan

This repo focuses on the work behind reliable reporting:

- clear business problem
- raw-to-clean pipeline
- explicit data contracts
- full and incremental load modes
- rejected-row reporting
- SQL KPI exports
- dbt-style staging/intermediate/mart SQL model views
- optional Airflow DAG for orchestration proof
- root-cause quality diagnosis and remediation backlog
- data lineage documentation
- dashboard-ready outputs
- tests, linting, Docker, CI, and secret scanning

## Live Demo

Streamlit Cloud URL: https://ahmed-retail-kpi-dashboard.streamlit.app/

The dashboard is demo-safe: if ignored KPI exports are missing, it generates synthetic data, runs the pipeline, verifies outputs, and then loads the dashboard.

## Business Case

Retail managers receive disconnected CSV exports from customer, product, order, and returns systems. The files contain duplicate records, inconsistent dates, invalid quantities, missing dimension links, and inconsistent formatting. This project builds a repeatable analytics pipeline that cleans those exports and produces reliable KPIs for revenue, margin, product, customer, returns, and data quality reporting.

## What This Project Demonstrates

- Python CLI pipeline for raw CSV ingestion, cleaning, validation, loading, and KPI export
- YAML data contracts for required columns, ID formats, ranges, dates, allowed values, duplicate keys, and foreign keys
- Full and incremental SQLite loading with idempotent reruns
- SQLite warehouse tables for dimensions, fact-style tables, and pipeline run metadata
- SQL KPI exports for executive reporting
- Lightweight dbt-style SQL model layer under `models/`
- Optional Airflow DAG showing scheduled validation, loading, modeling, and export flow
- Quality diagnosis report that turns validation issues into root-cause and remediation actions
- Lineage documentation for raw sources, trusted warehouse tables, model layers, and dashboards
- Pipeline health checks for required exports, quality score thresholds, and KPI/database consistency
- Streamlit dashboard with executive, sales, product, customer, and data-quality views
- CI with Ruff linting, Ruff format check, pytest coverage, smoke tests, export integrity checks, and secret scanning
- Docker and Docker Compose for reproducible local runs

## Outputs

- SQLite database: `data/processed/kpi_dashboard.sqlite`
- Cleaned CSVs: `data/processed/`
- Dashboard exports: `data/processed/dashboard_exports/`
- Data quality issues: `data/processed/dashboard_exports/data_quality_issues.csv`
- Data quality summary: `data/processed/dashboard_exports/data_quality_summary.csv`
- Pipeline run summary: `data/processed/dashboard_exports/pipeline_run_summary.csv`
- Data quality report: `docs/data_quality_report.md`
- Business insights: `docs/insights.md`
- Streamlit dashboard: `app/streamlit_dashboard.py`

Generated raw/processed files are ignored so the repository stays clean.
